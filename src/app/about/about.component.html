        Hi, my name is Muhammed Ismail, and I am a Software engineer from India. I began my journey in the IT industry
        in 2022 after joining Travancore Analytics Pvt Ltd. Since then, I have had the opportunity to work on various
        projects.

        I have also earned the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification, which not only provided me with a
        strong foundation in Cloud computing but also opened the gateway to the world of Cloud technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in books, exploring insightful YouTube videos, and socializing
        with friends.
